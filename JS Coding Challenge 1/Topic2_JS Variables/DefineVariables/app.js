/*Assignment: Create a numeric, string, and boolean variable and print them. 

Data types of different Variables 
1. Numbers/Numeric Data
a. integers 
b. float

2. Boolean (answer should be either True or false)
3. String(always typed in between "quotation marks")

 There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

Using var
Using let
Using const

But now we are using let for our basic understanding about this Assignment .*/

// For Example :I have 4 sisters

let brothers=4; // Integer(Number)
console.log(brothers)
console.log(typeof brothers);

// Suppose "A" is plot which is 6.9 feet long

let A= 22.18; // Data type is float(Number)
console.log(A)
console.log(typeof A);

// The percentage of student is 99.2%
let percentage = 99.2; // Data type is float (Number)
console.log(typeof percentage );

// Below is Boolean data type (student is pass or Fail in a test) 

let isPass= true; // boolean data type
console.log(isPass)//print Boolean Data in console
console.log(typeof isPass );//check its data type using console.log

 let isFail= false; // boolean data type
 console.log(typeof isFail);

 // Welcome to JavaScript Variables

let greeting="Welcome to JavaScript Variables ";
alert(greeting);
console.log(typeof greeting);
// we can check the above Variable types in the console log
